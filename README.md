# ToDo
* Finish NTCONST and add all "decoders" for the json string
  * find a way to display the speacial worlds on the console (e.g. world 102 as Pizza sewers)
* reformat console putput and add more values
* stream key from file so the user doesnt have to edit the .py file
* convert character variable from hardcoded list to file and read the file
* and more!

## ToDo (maybe)
* Add GUI with live update
* add evaluation of logfile in python, so the user doesnt have to use excel or similar
